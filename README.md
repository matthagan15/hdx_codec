# HDX_CODEC

This library builds high dimensional expanders for the use in error correcting codes for quantum and classical devices. The main way to 
interact with these objects is through the hdxplorer binary. Once installed, the following commands can be run
- build-coset-complex
- build-lps
- build-lr-cayley
- view-complex
- code-rate
